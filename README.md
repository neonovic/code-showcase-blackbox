This is an older project in a team of 5 developers. 
We were all brand new to Symfony 3.
And were tasked to create huge e-commerce application for an old legacy e-commerce project.
So, not to rewrite the legacy code, but develop a brand new application from scratch and synchronize with the legacy app for a while.

In this repository are few cherry picked files from one of my tasks/commits.
This is one of my first commercial project works, while learning Symfony from scratch.
The team also was learning the directory structure and best practices.

I am showing this code mainly for an overview of my previous type of work.

Nowaday, if I look back at this code - it's hard to remember what should be changed from the higher, architectural view.
But from the lower level - clean code point of view - I would probably rewrite mainly the nested if statements and replaced them with early returns :)
